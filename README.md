# Javascript-Boilerplates
My collection of most commonly used boilerplates when starting applications.

* `Angular` Angular boilerplate built on top of an express server
* `Angular-Socket` Angular / Socket boilerplate built on express server
* `Arduino-websocket` Arduino Yun ( can be customized for others ) web interface
* `Browserify` folder is for web apps that need a little help from my friends ( w/ gulp )
* `Node-ES6` Node es6 implementation converting using babel
* `Script` folder is for default server side javascript / node can be run
* `Web` folder is for default web apps needing to be required into web pages

All boilerplates are initialized with a default MIT Licesense as well a .gitignore for PHPStorm's automated `.idea/*` files
